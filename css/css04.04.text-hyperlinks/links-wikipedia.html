<p>Development of <i>Final Fantasy XIII-2</i> began in early 2010 and lasted about
  one and a half years. The game was unveiled at the Square Enix 1st Production Department
  Premier in January 2011. Many of the key designers remained in their roles from the previous game,
  and developer <a href="/wiki/Tri-Ace" title="Tri-Ace">tri-Ace</a> was hired to help with the game's design, art,
  and programming. The development team wanted to exceed <i>Final Fantasy XIII</i> in every aspect while making the
  story's tone mysterious and darker than the previous game. The game builds upon the Paradigm Shift battle system used
  in <i>Final Fantasy XIII</i> and includes a less linear overall design.
</p><p><i>Final Fantasy XIII-2</i> received critical acclaim in Japan and generally positive reviews from Western
  video game journalists. Though praised for its gameplay, lack of linearity, and graphics, the game's story was
  criticized as weak and confusing. The game was the fifth-best selling game of 2011 in Japan, and sold 3.1 million
  copies worldwide by January 2013. A sequel,
  <i><a href="/wiki/Lightning_Returns:_Final_Fantasy_XIII" title="Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII">Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII</a></i>,
  was released in 2013 in Japan and 2014 worldwide.
